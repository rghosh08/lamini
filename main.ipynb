In Lamini, on the other hand, you can declare the type of a variable using the `type` keyword.\\nAnother difference is that Python's type system is more flexible and allows for more dynamic typing, which means that you can change the type of a variable at runtime.

    "    {\"question\": \"Do I need to provide data as train and test split?\", \"answer\": \"No, the LLM Engine internally uses technologies like dev sets to calibrate training.  However, as a best practice in machine learning, we recommend that you develop your own test set that you do not add to the LLM Engine, that allows you to evaluate the performance of the LLM you are building without overfitting.  A gold test set should typically include 10s to 100s of examples that are sufficiently representative of your use case and include high quality labels.  We also recommend using human evaluation to judge the performance of the language model on your test set, instead of metrics like BLEU.\"},\n",

Is there a limit to the size of the training data it can handle effectively?\", \"answer\": \"Lamini can handle large-scale data sets and enforces no limits on the size of the training data.  Typically datasets are limited by the amount of data that can be sent to the LLM Engine through a client, which is typically limited by network bandwidth.  For example, on a 10Mbps internet connection, it would take about 2 minutes to send 100MB of data to the LLM Engine.\"},\n",
    "    {\"question\": \"Does Lamini support transfer learning from pre-trained models? Can I leverage existing models to accelerate the customization process?\", \"answer\": \"Every model available on HuggingFace is available as a starting point for customization. If you\\u2019d like to use a model which is not available publicly, please contact Lamini directly for deployment options.\"},\n",
    "    {\"question\": \"Can you provide details on how Lamini allows me to fine-tune or improve the performance of my customized LLM? What options or parameters can be adjusted?\", \"answer\": \"Lamini provides several options for fine-tuning and improving the performance of your customized LLM. You can adjust the model name, config settings, and input/output types. Additionally, Lamini allows you to submit jobs, check job status, and retrieve job results. You can also use the sample function to generate new program outputs, and the improve function to provide feedback and improve the model's performance. Other options include adding data, creating new functions, and adding metrics.\"},\n",

Does it handle text data in multiple languages or specific formats?\", \"answer\": \"Lamini can handle various types of data, including text data in multiple languages and specific formats. There are no specific restrictions or considerations regarding the types of data that can be used with Lamini.\"},\n",
    "    {\"question\": \"Can Lamini automatically handle hyperparameter tuning during the customization process? How does it optimize the model for a specific use case?\", \"answer\": \"Lamini is capable of automatically handling hyperparameter tuning during the model customization process. It employs an intelligent algorithm to explore the hyperparameter space and find the optimal combination of values. This is done through techniques such as heuristics, grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, or genetic algorithms. Lamini efficiently utilizes computational resources to evaluate multiple model instances with different hyperparameter configurations. It incorporates techniques like cross-validation to prevent overfitting and ensure generalization. By automating hyperparameter tuning, Lamini streamlines the machine learning workflow and improves the chances of developing high-performing models for specific use cases.\"},\n",
    "    {\"question\": \"Can you explain how Lamini handles the issue of overfitting during customization? Are there any regularization techniques or mechanisms in place?\", \"answer\": \"Lamini\\u2019s LLM engine is built to handle issues like overfitting during model training using standard methods including dropout and early stopping.\"},\n",
    "    {\"question\": \"How does Lamini handle the computational resources required for training customized LLMs? Can I leverage distributed computing or GPU acceleration?\", \"answer\": \"Lamini automatically leverages distributed computing and GPU acceleration to handle the computational resources required for training customized LLMs. You can leverage these options to speed up the training process and improve performance.  These are enabled by default in the LLM Engine.\"},\n",
    "    {\"question\": \"Can I deploy the customized LLM created with Lamini on various platforms or frameworks? Are there any specific deployment considerations or requirements?\", \"answer\": \"Yes, models can be deployed in any containerized environment. Lamini can also host your models for you.  The only requirements are the ability to run docker containers, and to supply powerful enough GPUs to run an LLM.\"},\n",
    "    {\"question\": \"Does Lamini provide any tools or functionality for monitoring and evaluating the performance of the customized LLM over time? Can I track metrics or analyze its behavior?\", \"answer\": \"Yes, Lamini provides tools for monitoring and evaluating the performance of the customized LLM over time. You can track metrics and analyze its behavior using the `add_metric` and `metrics` methods in the `LLM` class. Additionally, Lamini provides functionality for providing feedback to the LLM to improve its performance over time.\"},\n",
    "    {\"question\": \"Can you provide insights into the scalability of Lamini? Can it handle training multiple LLMs concurrently or on a large scale?\", \"answer\": \"Lamini is designed to be highly scalable and can handle training multiple LLMs concurrently or on a large scale. Additionally, Lamini uses distributed training techniques such as data parallelism, SHARP, and SLURM to efficiently train models across multiple machines. Overall, Lamini is well-suited for large-scale machine learning projects.\"}\n",
